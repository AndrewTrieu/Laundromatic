## Notes
- Executable files were created using [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.org/).
- The source code will be cleaned up in the next release. It is very messy and hard to read.
- The GUI will be updated in the next release. It looks outdated and crude.
- The executable files were not thoroughly tested on different environments and might not work as intended.
